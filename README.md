# Welcome to Doctelligence Foundation! üöÄ

Hello there! Thank you for visiting. This repository is dedicated to Doctelligence Foundation's initiative to develop an open-source, self-sovereign healthcare network designed as a public good.

**Abstract:** Health data, currently fragmented across various institutions, faces numerous challenges in terms of identification, retrieval, and efficient use in AI training. This framework proposes a new model that integrates:

1. Self-sovereign identity with a personal health data store.
2. A public blockchain-based federated learning protocol (FL) for AI training on these records.
3. An auditable reward system to ensure fair reward allocation, with rewards specifically designed to fund decentralized healthcare insurance solutions.

Patients, incentivized with digital wallet rewards, play a crucial role in this system, which also seeks to underpin future decentralized insurance models.

## Features:

- üìå **Self-Sovereign Identity and Personal Health Record Integration:** Ensuring that individuals maintain control over their personal health data.
- üñºÔ∏è **Public Blockchain-Based Federated Learning (FL):** Utilizing blockchain technology to securely train AI models on distributed datasets.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Auditable Trustless Reward System:** Creating a transparent mechanism for compensating data contributions, fostering a sustainable model for decentralized health insurance.

This initiative aligns with global strategies such as the WHO‚Äôs [Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020924) and supports the [Universal Health Coverage](https://www.who.int/europe/health-topics/universal-health-coverage) goals by improving access to healthcare services through enhanced data management and security.

## Global Alignment and Partnerships:

Doctelligence Foundation's work supports the objectives of several key international organizations, including:
- **WHO (World Health Organization)**: Enhancing global health data management and security.
- **UNDP (United Nations Development Programme)**: Supporting sustainable development goals related to health and well-being.
- **ITU (International Telecommunication Union)**: Promoting the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in healthcare.
- **World Bank**: Aligning with initiatives to improve healthcare access and infrastructure.

If you're as excited as we are about the potential of this project, dive right in! Below, you'll find all the information you need to get started, from setting up your environment to the intricacies of contribution.

Happy coding! ‚ú®
