# Welcome to Doctelligence Foundation! 🚀 

Hello there! Thank you for dropping by. This repository houses Doctelligence, our endeavor to open-source an entirely self-sovereign healthcare network as a public good.

**Abstract:** Health data, currently scattered across various institutions, poses challenges in identification, retrieval, and AI tool training. This paper introduces a framework that merges:

1. Self-sovereign identity with personal health data store.
2. A public blockchain-based federated learning protocol (FL) for AI training on these records.
3. An auditable reward system enabling fair reward allocation.

Patients, incentivized through digital wallet rewards, contribute to this system, which also aims to support decentralized insurance in the future.

## Features:

- 📌 Self-sovereign identity and personal health record integration
- 🖼️ Public blockchain-based federated learning (FL)
- 🛠️ Auditable trustless reward system

If you're as excited as we are about the potential of this project, dive right in! Below, you'll find all the information you need to get started, from setting up your environment to the intricacies of contribution.

Happy coding! ✨
