# Welcome to the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) üåêüß†

DIN Foundation is dedicated to establishing a self-sovereign, decentralized data network across various sectors for the public good.

## Mission

Our mission is to empower individuals with data sovereignty while facilitating effective AI training for societal benefit. We align our efforts with global initiatives promoting digital rights, privacy, and equitable access to technology.

## What We Do

At DIN Foundation, we focus on:

- **Ensuring Data Control:** Advocating for individual data control and ensuring that individuals benefit from advancements in AI technology.
- **Implementing Scalable Federated Learning:** Utilizing public blockchains to implement a scalable federated learning protocol.
- **Designing Fair Reward Mechanisms:** Developing trustless reward mechanisms to ensure fair participation incentives.

## Key Use Cases

Our work spans across various sectors:

- **Healthcare üè•:** Enabling patient-controlled health data for research and personalized care.
- **Finance üí∞:** Facilitating individual financial data management for tailored advice.
- **Education üìö:** Empowering students with ownership of academic records for customized learning.
- **Smart Cities üèôÔ∏è:** Enabling residents to manage urban data for optimized services.
- **Agriculture üåæ:** Providing farmers with control over agricultural data for improved practices.

## Public Goods, Governance, and Tokenomics

We emphasize social aspects and tangible value in our system architecture:

- **Public Goods Initiatives:** Inspired by initiatives like [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) funding and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)'s vision.
- **Governance Concepts:** Exploring innovative governance models such as [Gov4Git](https://gov4git.org/), quadratic voting, and delegate mechanisms.
- **Non-Speculative Tokenomics:** Implementing concepts like Harberger taxation and partial-common ownership, influenced by [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/).

## Alignment with Global Initiatives

Our work aligns with global standards and initiatives including:

- [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)
- [EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)
- [OECD Guidelines on Privacy Protection](https://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/privacy-guidelines.htm)
- [APEC Privacy Framework](https://www.apec.org/Publications/2017/08/APEC-Privacy-Framework-(2015))
